# Adventure Works Dashboard

## Project Overview

In the current business environment, where data plays a crucial role, the skill to harness data for informed decision-making sets professionals apart. To highlight my expertise in Power BI and data analytics, I utilized the Adventure Works dataset â€” a sample dataset centered around a bicycle company â€” to create dashboards that deliver comprehensive insights into sales trends, customer patterns, and product information. This project underscores my abilities in data storytelling, applying DAX formulas, and creating dynamic reports.

I dedicated over 16 hours to mastering the content and creating this interactive dashboard. The project was developed as part of a comprehensive Udemy course.

## Data Model and Table Relationships

This project is built on a robust data model that integrates multiple related tables: Sales Data, Customer Lookup, Product Lookup, Product Categories Lookup, and Calendar Lookup.

- The Sales Data table serves as the core, capturing detailed transaction records. 

- The Customer Lookup table offers demographic and behavioral insights for each customer. 

- The Product Lookup and Product Categories Lookup tables support analysis at both the product and category levels, linking product details to sales data. 

- The Calendar Lookup table facilitates time-based analysis, essential for identifying trends and patterns. 

- These interconnected tables allow for smooth integration and multi-dimensional analysis, leading to precise insights and impactful visualizations

### Data Model:

Data modeling is the foundation of any report, directly impacting its performance. In this project, we used the below snowflake schema for data modeling.
