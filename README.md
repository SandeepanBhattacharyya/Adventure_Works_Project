# Adventure Works Dashboard

## Project Overview

In the current business environment, where data plays a crucial role, the skill to harness data for informed decision-making sets professionals apart. To highlight my expertise in Power BI and data analytics, I utilized the Adventure Works dataset â€” a sample dataset centered around a bicycle company â€” to create dashboards that deliver comprehensive insights into sales trends, customer patterns, and product information. This project underscores my abilities in data storytelling, applying DAX formulas, and creating dynamic reports.

I dedicated over 16 hours to mastering the content and creating this interactive dashboard. The project was developed as part of a comprehensive Udemy course.
